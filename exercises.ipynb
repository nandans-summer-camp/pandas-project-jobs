    "Today we're going to focus on some data that has information we want, but the information is not properly *structured*. In particular, it comes as a single column with a string value, and we want to turn it into a series of boolean columns.\n",

    "To do that, we're going to use the powerful built-in methods Python provides us to work with strings. You can read all about the available methods here: \n",

    "In particular, we're going to use `.split()`, which is a method that turns a string into a list of strings, and `.strip()`, which removes the \"whitespace\" from a string."
